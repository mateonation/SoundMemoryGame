# SoundMemoryGame
Made by Mateo Fernández Rivera

## 📄 DESCRIPTION
This is a game made with _HTML, CSS and javascript._ It is a replica of the classic game 'Simon' in which four colored blocks on the screen emit a series of sounds at random that the user must repeat. Each time the user completes each series without making any mistakes, the program repeats the previous sequence again, adding a new sound to the end of it.
